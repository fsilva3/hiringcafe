Our platform empowers clients to compose, adapt, and scale intelligent systems for Fixed Income markets with a level of configurability and control that was previously impossible.Our Software Integration Engineers are solution architects and technical engagement leads who collaborate directly with clients to deliver customized workflows and integrations.

This is a high-impact integration role for engineers who want to own solutions, talk to clients, and shape systems that get used. You’ll operate at the center of business logic, architecture, and client delivery—where technology meets the market.You’ll need to have:- 5+ years of experience in software engineering, systems integration or solution architecture in complex enterprise environments.- Strong understanding of distributed systems principles and how to troubleshoot, configure, and optimize large-scale services.- Experience in real-time or high-throughput system environments—preferably in capital markets or a similarly time-sensitive domain.- Excellent communication skills: you can explain, persuade, and guide both technical and non-technical audiences.- Familiarity with databases (SQL) and scripting languages to support integration and customization work.- An advanced degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, or equivalent hands-on experience.- Experience collaborating directly with customers to deliver software—either through integration or developmentWe’d love to see:- Front-office trading or capital markets exposure, especially in Fixed Income.- Proven ability to turn business objectives into system designs and integration plans.- Curiosity and depth—willingness to push past surface-level requirements to design robust, scalable solutions.- Self-direction and ownership in navigating people, process, and technology.- A collaborative mindset—sharing insights, building on others' work, and elevating team capabilities.If this sounds like you, please apply!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Salary Range = 160000 - 240000 USD Annually + Benefits + BonusThe referenced salary range is based on the Company's good faith belief at the time of posting.

About the Inclusion Center of Excellence (COE) The Inclusion Center of Excellence sets the enterprise direction, standards, and capabilities for Inclusion at Bloomberg. The COE enables consistent, high-quality Inclusion decisions by defining guardrails, embedding standards into HR systems, and equipping Talent Partners, HR Business Partners, and business leaders with insight and tools.

Our platform empowers clients to compose, adapt, and scale intelligent systems for Fixed Income markets with a level of configurability and control that was previously impossible.Our Software Integration Engineers are solution architects and technical engagement leads who collaborate directly with clients to deliver customized workflows and integrations.

This is a high-impact integration role for engineers who want to own solutions, talk to clients, and shape systems that get used. You’ll operate at the center of business logic, architecture, and client delivery—where technology meets the market.You’ll need to have:- 5+ years of experience in software engineering, systems integration or solution architecture in complex enterprise environments.- Strong understanding of distributed systems principles and how to troubleshoot, configure, and optimize large-scale services.- Experience in real-time or high-throughput system environments—preferably in capital markets or a similarly time-sensitive domain.- Excellent communication skills: you can explain, persuade, and guide both technical and non-technical audiences.- Familiarity with databases (SQL) and scripting languages to support integration and customization work.- An advanced degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, or equivalent hands-on experience.- Experience collaborating directly with customers to deliver software—either through integration or developmentWe’d love to see:- Front-office trading or capital markets exposure, especially in Fixed Income.- Proven ability to turn business objectives into system designs and integration plans.- Curiosity and depth—willingness to push past surface-level requirements to design robust, scalable solutions.- Self-direction and ownership in navigating people, process, and technology.- A collaborative mindset—sharing insights, building on others' work, and elevating team capabilities.If this sounds like you, please apply!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Salary Range = 160000 - 240000 USD Annually + Benefits + BonusThe referenced salary range is based on the Company's good faith belief at the time of posting.

About the Inclusion Center of Excellence (COE) The Inclusion Center of Excellence sets the enterprise direction, standards, and capabilities for Inclusion at Bloomberg. The COE enables consistent, high-quality Inclusion decisions by defining guardrails, embedding standards into HR systems, and equipping Talent Partners, HR Business Partners, and business leaders with insight and tools.
